## Anatomy of a switch

Before we get into it, let's take apart one MX-compatible switch so you can understand the terms used when talking about switches throughout the rest of this guide.

Top, bottom, spring, stem

## Why lube your switches?

Lubing your switches is totally optional. But many keyboard enthusiasts will tell you it is an absolute MUST.  Personally, I didn't lube a single switch until I'd been in the hobby for 1.5 years (and approximately 5-6 keyboards).

But here are some of the main reasons keyboard enthusiasts lube their switches:

* Smoother feel
* Different (better?) sound
* Get rid of scratchy or high-pitched ping feel/sound

## What materials/supplies do I need to lube my own switches?

Here are the bare minimum supplies:
1. At least 1 mL lube 
1. Switches to be lubed
1. A small-tipped instrument to spread the lube 
    1. I use size 0 and 3/0 regular paintbrushes you can get at any art store.
1. Something to open the switches 
    1. There are things called switch openers specifically designed to open the two main types of MX-compatible mechanical keyboard switches, but you could also use tweezers or a small flathead screwdriver. Some people have even said they open it using their fingernails, but that sounds unnecessarily painful/tedious to me.
1. A comfortable, well lit area

Here are some other (optional) helpful tools:
1. Tweezers. I prefer ones with angled (not pointed) ends for keyboard work. In this context, they're really helpful for holding, separating, and placing springs, stems, and films. 
1. Something to hold your disassembled switch parts
    1. There are things called "lube stations" that are sold on lots of keyboard shops and etsy shops. I have a nice wooden one I bought and like to use. But a lot of people use small plates and bowls to hold the components while they're working. You could even just have piles on a clean desk tbh.
    1. If you're going to bag-lube or tub-lube any pieces (more on what that means below) then you need a small seal-able plastic bag and/or a small plastic container with a lid.
1. A "gripping" tool to hold your stems while you lube them. There are 4-prong holders, there are lead pencil holders, there are probably other kinds of holders that would work. Sold in most keyboard shops.
1. Switch films. If the top of the switch housing feels loose when attached to the bottom, with a lot of wiggle from side to side, OR if the stem wobbles a lot in a vertical or horizontal direction inside the top of the housing, your switches might benefit from switch films. These are little foam or plastic frames that go in between the top and the bottom housing to get a tighter fit.
1. Multiple types of lube. Some people use different lube for the springs than the rest of the switch, different lube for stabs vs switches, or different lubes for different types of switches. This is optional, but if you aren't sure what you like, the best way to find out what you like is to try different types for yourself. We who are experienced can make recommendations, but like everything else in this hobby, the "perfect" switch lubing always comes down to personal preference.

## What kind of lube should I buy?

First, I've heard people say "I don't want to buy real lube, can I use X to lube my switches?"  The answer is NO.  No butter. No olive oil. No vegetable oil. No spray lube. No vaseline. No WD-40. You are trying to lubricate plastic-on-plastic and metal-on-plastic connections. You need to avoid anything that corrodes metal or melts plastic over time.

Here are the most commonly recommended lubes for mechanical keyboard switches:
* Krytox 205g0
* Krytox 105
* Tribosys 3204
* Tribosys 3203
* Krytox 205g1
* Krytox XHT-BDZ
* Krytox 106
* Dialectric grease

I'm sure there are other brands that are OK for switch lubing but I don't know what they are.

## That didn't answer my question. I asked for one recommendation and I got 8 options. Which ONE should I buy?

The correct answer is: whichever one you like the feel of best.  But that's a mean answer to give to someone who has no idea what they want or like yet. So here are some guidelines to help you decide what to try first.

* If you're lubing linear switches, almost everyone recommends you start with Krytox 205g0. However, any of the lubes listed above might suit you depend on your preference, except dialectric grease or Krytox XHT-BDZ. These are not recommended because they're too thick; they are better for stabs.
* If you're lubing tactile switches, you *can* use Krytox 205g0, but be aware that it will significantly affect the tactility of the switch. I have a lot more I can say about lubing tactile switches, as they're my favorite type of switch.
    * First, EVERYONE'S first piece of advice is don't lube the legs of the stem, regardless of what type of lube you're using.
    * As for which lube to use, I personally recommend Tribosys 3203 if you want to preserve as much of the tactile feel as possible. It is the thinnest out of the top 3 most common switch lubes, which are 205g0, 3204, and 3203.
    * General rule is if you want to preserve the tactile bump use no lube or use the thinnest lube you can tolerate. If you don't care about the tactile bump feel, you just want a smoother press, then you can use the thicker lubes that are popular for linear switches.
    * TLDR: For smoothness, use 205g0. For tactility, use 3203. For a compromise in the middle, use 3204.
* If you're lubing box switches or clicky switches, then stop. Don't do that.

Special notes about springs:
* If you're OK with buying multiple types of lube, most enthusiasts would recommend you use oil like Krytox 105 or Krytox 106 on your springs.
* If you're not ready to make multiple purchases yet, you can brush-lube or donut-dip using the same lube as you used on your switches and that will work just fine.  (More on those techniques later, if you don't know what they mean.)

Special notes about stabs:
* Many people prefer a thicker lube on their stabilizers than they do on their switches. So, the best choices from the list above for stabilizers are: Krytox 205g0, Krytox XHT-BDZ, or dialectic grease.

I am located in the US, and I personally recommend 3dkeebs, dangkeebs, and divinikey for lube and other switch modification supplies.

## OK, I have all my supplies. Now what do I do?

Set aside a few hours for lubing all your switches. Put on some music or some TV if you need background entertainment.  The amount of time it will actually take depends on your speed (duh) but also how many switches you're trying to lube. Lubing switches for a 40% board will obviously be a lot faster than lubing switches for a TKL or an 1800.

First, here are descriptions of the common methods for switch lubing:
* **Brush lubing.** Use your thin paintbrush to spread a thin layer of lube evenly across the surface you are lubing. Thin = you should be able to tell it's there when you look at it, but just barely. It shouldn't be a completely opaque layer.
    * When brush lubing stems or springs, a gripping tool or a set of tweezers is very handy!
* **Donut dipping. (for springs)** With your lube in a tub or on a small surface, holding one end of a spring with your fingers / a gripping tool / tweezers, dip the other end of the spring into the lube until it covers the tightly coiled part at the bottom of the spring. Pull it out of the lube. If there's a lot, you might need to wipe some off. If the lube is covering the hole at the bottom of the spring, blow on it to make sure the hole in the spring is cleared.  The idea here is that the lubed end goes in the bottom of the switch, and as you press the switch more and more, it will compress down to the lube and then spread evenly over the switch.
* **Bag lubing (for springs)** Put all of your springs in a sealable plastic bag. Put approximately one drop of Krytox 105 or 106 oil in the bag for every 10 switches. Seal the bag and shake until the oil is evenly distributed.
* **Tub lubing. (for either springs or stems)** Put all your stems/springs in a small tub with a lid. Use your brush or another small instrument to smear some lube on the sides of the tub. (This will work with thicker lubes too, not just oils.) Put the lid on the tub and shake until the lube is evenly distributed.

With all of these methods, **BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERLUBE**. You can always add more if you find the switches are still scratchy or pingy or don't feel as smooth as you'd like. But it is a huge pain to have to thoroughly clean all the components and then start over from scratch because there's too much lube.

Actual recommended steps for lubing:
1. Open your switches one by one. Place the 4 components - spring, stem, top housing, bottom housing - into your lube station, or in to separate dishes / bowls / piles.
1. Do any bag/tub lubing you plan to do.
1. Now do the rest of your lubing.
    1. Some people like to do the switch-by-switch approach of doing all four components for one switch, putting it back together, then moving onto the next switch.
    1. I prefer to bag lube my springs, then do all of the bottom housings, then all the stems, then all the top housings and reassemble them all at the end. I've heard others in the hobby say this method is faster for them, but I can't confirm that's true. It's just what feels better to me.
1. No matter which big-picture approach you use, bottom to top works best. Start by lubing the rails of the bottom housing. Lightly lube the inside and outside of the shaft in the middle. If you're lubing linear switches that have a lot of leaf ping, you can also lube the metal leaf. (Lubing the leaf not recommended for tactile switches.)
1. Next deal with your spring. If you bag/tub lubed your springs in step 2, place one already-lubed spring from the bag/tub in each bottom housing. If you're brush lubing or donut dipping, lube each spring as described in the method above, then place it in a bottom housing as you finish it.
1. Now lube the stem. If brush lubing, hold the part of the stem that looks like a + with your fingers or a gripping tool.
    1. If you're lubing linear switches, you can apply a thin layer of lube to all of the surfaces: sides, front, back, legs, pole.
    1. If you're lubing tactile switches and you want to preserve tactility, just lube the sides and the pole.
1. Place the stem pole in the spring, with the legs oriented toward the side of the bottom housing with the metal leaf.
1. If you're going to use switch films, NOW is the right time to place them. Align them with the outer border of the bottom housing, one in each switch. Tweezers are really helpful here!
1. Finally, lube the side rails of the top housing. Place the top housing over the stem/spring/bottom housing combo and press down until all side tabs click. (Two tabs on Kailh style switches; four tabs for other MX style switches.) It's recommended you also press down on the stem to depress the spring at the same time, to help with top-bottom alignment.

The first time you lube switches, I recommend doing one or two start-to-finish, then testing them out and comparing them to stock switches before doing the rest. This lets you see, feel, and hear what a difference your hard work will make! You can identify if the switch feels sluggish (overlubed) or still has scratch/ping or isn't smooth enough (underlubed). Adjust until you get to a good level of lubing, then do that for all the rest of your switches.
